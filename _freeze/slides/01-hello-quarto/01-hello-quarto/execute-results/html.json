Consistent with this commitment, it is the policy of the ASA that all participants in ASA activities enjoy a welcoming environment free from unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n\n::: aside\n[ASA Code of Conduct](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/code-of-conduct)\n:::\n\n## Expected Behavior {.smaller}\n\n> -   Model and support the norms of respect necessary to promote the conditions for healthy exchange of scientific ideas.\n>\n> -   In speech or conduct, do not insult or disparage other participants.\n>\n> -   Be conscious of hierarchical structures, specifically the existence of stark power differentials between students, early career statisticians and established career statisticians---noting that fear of retaliation from more established statisticians can make it difficult for students and early career statisticians to express discomfort, rebuff unwelcome advances, and report violations of the conduct policy.\n>\n> -   Be sensitive to indications that may suggest that individuals are feeling unwelcome.\n\n::: aside\n[ASA Code of Conduct](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/code-of-conduct)\n:::\n\n## About me\n\n-   Professor of the Practice, Department of Statistical Science, Duke University\n-   Developer Educator, Posit\n-   R Markdown user/educator for 10+ years, Quarto user/educator for 1+ years\n\n## About you\n\n::: task\nMeet 1-2 people around you!\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountdown(minutes = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_72eba494\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">02</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Workshop structure\n\n-   **My turn:** Lecture segments + live coding\n\n-   **Our turn:** Live coding + follow along\n\n-   **Your turn:** Exercises\n\n## Getting help\n\n- During **my turn** and **our turn** segments -- raise your hand\n\n- During **your turn** segments -- also feel free to raise your hand for questions but use the stickies to signal:\n\n    - Light green: I'd like some help / I'm stuck / I'm lost\n    - Dark green: I'm done\n\n# Hello Quarto\n\n## Meeting you where you are\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\nI'll **assume** you\n\n-   know some R\n\n-   have worked in RStudio\n\n-   want to learn about Quarto\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {.fragment .fade-in}\nI'll **teach** you\n\n-   Quarto syntax and formats\n\n-   More Markdown\n\n-   Even more R along the way!\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Checking in one more time {.smaller}\n\n::: task\nHave you completed the following?\n\n-   Download and install the latest versions of R, RStudio, and Quarto:\n\n    -   R: <https://cran.r-project.org>\n    -   RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop>\n    -   Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started>\n\n-   Install the following packages:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    pkg_list <- c(\n      \"tidyverse\", \"gt\", \"reactable\", \"ggiraph\",\n      \"here\", \"palmerpenguins\", \"fs\", \"skimr\"\n      )\n    install.packages(pkg_list)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n::: {.hand-blue-large style=\"text-align: center;\"}\nLet's get started!\n:::\n\n# What is Quarto?\n\n## Quarto ...\n\n-   is a new, open-source, scientific, and technical publishing system\n-   aims to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better\n\n![Artwork from \"Hello, Quarto\" keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022.
